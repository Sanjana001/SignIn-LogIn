This is a very small project in which there is only a SignIn and LogIn form which pops up after a particular intervals of time.
This project has also a database.
As I don't know how to upload database in github. Thus I am attaching the "sql" file of my database with this repository with the help of which you can get the information about the database in your system.

Note: While executing the "index.php" file make sure that your clone repository should present under the "htdocs" directory as I made the database and other files with "XAMPP" software.
